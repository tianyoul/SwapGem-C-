# SwapGem-C-

This is a 2D GemSwap game coded using C++ with OpenGL and GLUT.

Non visible features:

- when a cell is clicked with key 'B' held down, the gem in the cell disappears.
- when key 'Q' is held down, the visible window (i.e. the 2D camera position) shakes violently (you may add a high-freq sin function of time to the position). During the quake, in every frame, all gems stand a 0.1% chance of disappearing.
- when key 'A' or 'D' is held down, rotate the 2D camera in counterclockwise or clockwise direction, respectively.
